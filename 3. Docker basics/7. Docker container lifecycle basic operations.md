# Docker Container Basic Operations

Purpose of the this hands-on training is to give students the knowledge of basic operation on Docker containers.

## Learning Outcomes

At the end of the this hands-on training, students will be able to;

- list the help about the Docker commands.
- run a Docker container on EC2 instance.
- list the running and stopped Docker containers.
- explain the properties of Docker containers.
- start, stop, and remove Docker containers.

## Outline

- Part 1 - Launch a Docker Machine Instance and Connect with SSH
- Part 2 - Basic Container Commands of Docker

## Part 1 - Launch a Docker Machine Instance and Connect with SSH

- Launch a Docker machine on Amazon Linux 2 AMI with security group allowing SSH connections using the [Cloudformation Template for Docker Machine Installation](../docker-01-installing-on-ec2-linux2/docker-installation-template.yml).
- Connect to your instance with SSH.

```bash
ssh -i NAME.pem ec2-user@IP
```

## Part 2 - Basic Container Commands of Docker

- Check if the docker service is up and running.

```bash
sudo systemctl status docker
```

- Run either `docker` or `docker help` to see the help docs about docker commands.

```bash
docker help | less
```

- Run `docker COMMAND --help` to see more information about specific command.

```bash
docker run --help | less
```

- Download and run `ubuntu` os with interactive shell open.

```bash
docker run -i -t ubuntu
```

- Display the os name on the container for the current user.

```bash
cat /etc/os-release
```

- Display the shell name on the container for the current user.

```bash
echo $0
```

- Update and upgrade os packages on `ubuntu` container.

```bash
apt-get update && apt-get upgrade -y
```

- Show that `ubuntu` container is like any other Ubuntu system but limited.
    - Go to the home folder and create a file named as `devops.txt`
        
        ```bash
        cd ~ && touch devops.txt && ls
        ```
        
    - Try to edit `devops.txt` file with `vim` editor and show that there is no `vim` installed.
        
        ```bash
        vim devops.txt
        ```
        
    - Install `vim` editor.
        
        ```bash
        apt-get install vim
        ```
        
    - Edit `devops.txt` file with `vim` editor and type `Hello from the Ubuntu Container` to show that `vim` command can be run now.
        
        ```bash
        vim devops.txt
        ```
        
- Exit the `ubuntu` container and return to ec2-user bash shell.

```bash
exit
```

- Show the list of all containers available on Docker machine and explain container properties.

```bash
docker ps -a
```

- Run the second `ubuntu` os with interactive shell open and name container as `busybox-1` and show that this `ubuntu` container is different from the previous one.

```bash
docker run -i -t --name busybox-1 busybox
```

- Exit the `ubuntu` container and return to ec2-user bash shell.

```bash
exit
```

- Show the list of all containers again and explain the second `ubuntu` containersâ€™ properties and how the names of containers are given.

```bash
docker ps -a
```

- Restart the first container by its `ID`.

```bash
docker start busybox-1
```

- Show only running containers and explain the status.

```bash
docker ps
```

- Stop the first container by its `ID` and show it is stopped.

```bash
docker stop busybox-1 && docker ps -a
```

- Restart the `busybox-1` container by its name and list only running containers.

```bash
docker start busybox-1 && docker ps
```

## Part-3 - Command execution in running container

- Connect to the interactive shell of running `busybox-1` container and `exit` afterwards.

```bash
docker run -itd --name busybox-1 busybox
```

- Show that `busybox` container is running by listing all containers.

```bash
docker ps -a
```

- Show that we can get more information about `busybox-1` container by using `docker inspect` command and explain the properties.

```bash
docker inspect busybox-1 | less
```

- Create a file inside container using `exec`

```bash
docker exec -it busybox-1 touch hi.txt
```

- Explore inside the container with shell

```bash
docker exec -it busybox-1 sh
```
