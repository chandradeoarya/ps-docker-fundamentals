## **1. Introduction to Docker Architecture**

Docker architecture is the way Docker components are organized and interact with each other. Understanding Docker's architecture will help you grasp how Docker works and how you can use it to build, ship, and run your applications.

## **2. Understanding Docker Components**

Docker's architecture consists of three main components:

1. Docker Engine
2. Docker Images
3. Docker Containers

### **Docker Engine**

Docker Engine is the runtime that builds and runs Docker containers. It's a client-server type of application that consists of:

- A server which is a type of long-running program called a daemon process (the **`dockerd`** command).
- A REST API which specifies interfaces that programs can use to talk to the daemon and instruct it what to do.
- A command-line interface (CLI) client (the **`docker`** command).

### **Docker Images**

A Docker image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software, including the code, a runtime, libraries, environment variables, and config files.

### **Docker Containers**

A Docker container is a runnable instance of a Docker image. You can create, start, stop, move, or delete a container using the Docker API or CLI.

## **3. Docker Architecture: An In-Depth Look**

The Docker architecture works in a client-server model. The Docker client communicates with the Docker daemon, which does the heavy lifting of building, running, and distributing Docker containers.

### **Docker Client and Docker Daemon**

Docker Client is where the user interacts with Docker, usually through the Docker command line interface (CLI). The Docker client (CLI) communicates with the Docker daemon using REST API calls. The Docker client and daemon can run on the same host, or you can connect a Docker client to a remote Docker daemon.

### **Docker Registries**

A Docker registry is a storage and content delivery system for named Docker images. Docker Hub and Docker Cloud are public registries that anyone can use, and Docker is configured to look for images on Docker Hub by default.

### **Docker Objects**

When you use Docker, you create and manage objects, such as images, containers, networks, and volumes.

### Docker Images

A Docker image is read-only. When Docker starts a container from an image, it adds a read-write layer on top of the image in which your application can then run.

```bash
docker run hello-world
```

This command runs the **`hello-world`** image in a container.

### Docker Containers

A container is a runnable instance of an image. You can create, start, stop, move, or delete a container using Docker API or CLI.

```bash
docker ps
```

This command lists all running containers.
