# Using image from Dockerhub
Docker Hub is a cloud-based public registry provided by Docker, Inc. In this hands-on lesson you will learn searching an image from Dockerhub and pulling it.

- Create a repository with the name of `flask-app` and description of `This image repo holds Flask apps.`.
- Check if the docker service is up and running on EC2 instance.

```bash
systemctl status docker
```

- List images in Docker and explain properties of images.

```bash
docker image ls
```

- Download Docker image `ubuntu` and explain image tags (defaults to `latest`) on Docker Hub. Show `ubuntu` repo on Docker Hub and which version the `latest` tag corresponds to (`20.04`).

```bash
# Defaults to ubuntu:latest
docker image pull ubuntu
docker image ls
```

- Run `ubuntu` as container with interactive shell open.

```bash
docker run -it ubuntu
```

- Display the `ubuntu` os info on the container (`VERSION="20.04 LTS (Focal Fossa)"`) and note that the `latest` tag is showing release `20.04` as in the Docker Hub. Then exit the container.

```bash
cat /etc/os-release
exit
```

- Download earlier version (`18.04`) of `ubuntu` image, which is tagged as `18.04` on Docker Hub and explain image list.

```bash
docker image pull ubuntu:18.04
docker image ls
```

- Inspect `ubuntu` image and explain properties.

```bash
# Defaults to ubuntu:latest
docker image inspect ubuntu
# Ubuntu with tag 18.04
docker image inspect ubuntu:18.04
```

- Search for Docker Images both on `bash` and on Docker Hub.

```bash
docker search ubuntu
```
