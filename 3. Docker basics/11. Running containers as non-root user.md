## Introduction

In this lab we will learn enabling a non-root user to run Docker containers on your system. By default, Docker requires root privileges for most operations. 

However, for improved security practices, it's recommended to allow users to interact with Docker without needing root access.

### **Objectives:**

- Understand the security benefits of running Docker as a non-root user.
- Configure Docker to allow non-root user access.
- Run basic Docker commands (ps, run, stop) as a non-root user.

## **Lab Environment:**

- This lab assumes you have a Linux system with Docker installed.
- You'll need a user account with sudo privileges but **not** root access.

## **Step-by-Step Instructions:**

**1. Verify Docker Installation:**

Open a terminal window and verify Docker is installed by running the following command:

```bash
docker version
```

This should display information about the Docker version installed on your system.

**2. Create a Docker Group (if not already present):**

By default, Docker has a group named `docker`. If it's missing, create it using the following command with sudo privileges:

```bash
sudo groupadd docker
```

**3. Add Your User to the Docker Group:**

Create a new user that will be used to run Docker containers.

```bash
sudo useradd -m chandra
```

Use the `usermod` command with sudo privileges to add your user account to the `docker` group:

```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker chandra
```

Here `chandra` can be replaced by any `username`.

**4. Verify Group Membership:**

Verify if the user belongs to the group using the `groups` command:

```bash
groups chandra
```

**5. Log Out and Log Back In (Optional):**

For the changes to take effect, it's recommended to log out and log back in to your user account. This ensures your user session reflects the updated group membership.

**6. Run Docker Commands as Non-Root User:**

Now you should be able to run basic Docker commands without needing sudo. Try listing running containers.

**7. Run a Sample Container:**

Use the `docker run` command (without sudo) to launch a simple container:

```bash
docker run hello-world
```

### **Conclusion:**

By following these steps, you've enabled your non-root user to interact with Docker for basic operations. This enhances security by minimizing the use of root privileges. 

In some cases, you may need to run containers with extended privileges (e.g., accessing host devices or running specific system commands). To do so, you can use the `--privileged` flag when running the container.

```bash
docker run --privileged <container-image>
```
