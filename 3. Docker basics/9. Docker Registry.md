## **Docker Registry**

A Docker registry is a central repository for storing and distributing Docker images. It serves as a server-side application that allows users to upload, download, and manage Docker images. Registries are essential for sharing and distributing container images within a development team or across different environments.

### **Key Features of Docker Registry**

1. **Image Storage**: Docker registries store Docker images as versioned artifacts. Images consist of multiple layers representing different parts of the file system, along with metadata about the image and its dependencies. Repositories organize images into logical collections.
2. **Authentication and Access Control**: Registries enforce access control policies to ensure authorized users or systems can upload or download images. Authentication mechanisms, such as usernames and passwords or access tokens, secure the registry.
3. **Image Distribution**: Users can push (upload) Docker images to the registry and pull (download) images from it. Pulling an image retrieves the necessary layers and metadata to create a local instance of the image on the user's Docker host. Image distribution can be controlled based on defined permissions and access levels.
4. **Private Registries**: Organizations often set up private Docker registries to control their container images and maintain data security. Private registries are suitable for storing proprietary or sensitive images not intended for public distribution.
