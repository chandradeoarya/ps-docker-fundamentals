## Introduction

Docker utilizes a layered filesystem to construct images. This layering system and immutability provide several benefits, including efficient image sharing, faster deployment, and improved security. 

In this lesson, we will explore Docker image layering, the concept of immutability, and how they influence containerized application development.

## Docker Image Layering

Docker images are composed of multiple layers, each representing a set of instructions or changes made during the image build process. These layers are stacked on top of each other, forming the final image.

### **Layered Like an Onion**

Imagine a Docker image as an onion. Each layer represents a specific change made to the filesystem. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Base Layer:** The foundation is usually a base image, like Ubuntu or Python. This layer contains the operating system and essential libraries.
2. **Instruction Layers:** On top of the base, you add layers with instructions like `COPY` to add application code, `RUN` to install dependencies, or `EXPOSE` to define ports. Each instruction creates a new layer with the specific changes.

**For example, consider the following Dockerfile:**

```docker
FROM ubuntu:20.04
RUN apt-get update
RUN apt-get install -y nginx
COPY index.html /var/www/html/index.html
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
```

In this Dockerfile, each `RUN` instruction and the `COPY` instruction create a new layer on top of the base Ubuntu image. The resulting Docker image will have four layers:

1. Base Ubuntu image layer
2. Layer with `apt-get update`
3. Layer with `apt-get install -y nginx`
4. Layer with `COPY index.html /usr/share/nginx/html/`
5. Layer with `CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]`

**Benefits of Layering:**

- **Efficiency:** Since layers are reused across images that share the same base, they save disk space and build time.
- **Transparency & security:** You can see the exact changes introduced in each layer, making troubleshooting easier.

### **Immutability: Keeping Things Fixed**

A core principle of Docker images is immutability. Once a layer is created, its content cannot be modified. This ensures:

- **Reproducibility:** Building an image always results in the same environment, regardless of location or builder.
- **Security:** Layers cannot be tampered with, reducing vulnerabilities.

### **Making Changes:**

If you want to modify an image, you don't edit existing layers. Instead, you create a new image with additional layers on top, referencing the original image.
