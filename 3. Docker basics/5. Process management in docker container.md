## **Single Process in Docker**

- **Core Principle:** Docker containers are designed to encapsulate a single process or a small group of tightly coupled processes that work together to achieve a specific functionality. This promotes isolation, simplicity, and reproducibility.
- **Benefits:**
    - **Isolation:** Each container runs in its own isolated environment, preventing conflicts between applications and dependencies.
    - **Simplicity:** Focusing on a single process makes container images smaller and easier to manage.
    - **Reproducibility:** If all dependencies are included in the image, the container's behavior will be consistent across different environments.

## **Why Not Multiple Processes by Default?**

Docker does allow running multiple processes within a container but it's generally discouraged due to following reasons:

- **Scaling:** Docker orchestration tools like Docker Swarm or Kubernetes are designed to manage containers, each representing a single service. Scaling a multi-process container becomes less straightforward.
- **Complexity:** Managing dependencies and interactions between multiple processes within a container can increase complexity.
- **Isolation:** Running multiple processes might introduce potential conflicts or resource contention.

**When Might Multiple Processes Be Used?**

There can be exceptions where multiple processes are necessary in a container:

- **Sidecar Pattern:** A container might run a primary application process alongside a sidecar container that provides necessary functionality, like logging or monitoring.
- **Supervisory Process:** In rare cases, a lightweight process manager like Supervisord can be used within a container to manage multiple interdependent processes, but this can add complexity.

## **`systemd` in Docker**

Using systemd inside Docker containers is generally **not recommended**.

- **Reasons:**
    - **Duplication of Functionality:** Docker already handles many system-level tasks that systemd would attempt to manage, leading to potential conflicts.
    - **Isolation Concerns:** systemd often interacts with the host system in ways that can compromise Docker's isolation model. Running systemd with elevated privileges (`-privileged` flag) defeats the purpose of containerization.
