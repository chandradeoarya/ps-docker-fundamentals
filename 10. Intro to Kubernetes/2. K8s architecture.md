## Introduction

Kubernetes follows a client-server architecture, comprising several components that work together to manage containerized applications. 

The architecture is designed to be highly scalable, resilient, and flexible, making it suitable for managing large-scale deployments of containerized applications across multiple nodes. In this lesson we will break down the core components of Kubernetes architecture.

## **The Big Picture: Control Plane vs. Nodes**

Imagine a Kubernetes cluster as a mini-datacenter. It consists of two main parts:

- **Control Plane:** The brain of the operation. It manages worker nodes, schedules tasks, and ensures everything runs according to plan.
- **Nodes (Worker Machines):** The workhorses that run your containerized applications. These can be physical or virtual machines.

## **Inside the Control Plane:**

The control plane is made up of several key components, each playing a specific role:

- **etcd:** Acts as a high-availability key-value store, holding the desired state configuration of your cluster. Think of it as the central storage for cluster information.
- **kube-apiserver:** The API gateway for Kubernetes. It accepts requests from tools and applications to interact with the cluster. This is where you'd interact with Kubernetes using kubectl, the command-line tool.
- **kube-scheduler:** As the name suggests, this component schedules tasks (Pods) to be run on worker nodes based on specific criteria like resource availability.
- **kube-controller-manager:** A collection of controllers that constantly monitor the state of the cluster and take corrective actions if there are deviations from the desired state.
- **Cloud-controller-manager (Optional):** Manages communication with cloud providers for features like service load balancing.

## **Worker Nodes:  Where the Action Happens**

Each worker node runs several crucial components:

- **Container Runtime Engine:** (e.g., Docker, containerd) The software responsible for running container images and managing their lifecycle.
- **kubelet:** The agent on each node that communicates with the control plane. It receives instructions on what Pods to run and ensures they are running smoothly.
- **kube-proxy:** Manages network traffic for Pods within the cluster. It acts like a traffic director, ensuring Pods can communicate with each other.
