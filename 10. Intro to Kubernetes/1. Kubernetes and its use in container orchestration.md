## What is Kubernetes

Kubernetes, often abbreviated as K8s, is a popular container orchestration platform developed by Google. It automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. Originally designed by Google and later donated to the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), Kubernetes has rapidly become the industry standard for container orchestration.

### **Key Features of Kubernetes**

- **Container Orchestration:** Kubernetes provides automated deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications across clusters of hosts.
- **Service Discovery and Load Balancing:** Kubernetes offers built-in service discovery and load balancing for containerized services, making it easy to deploy microservices architectures.
- **Self-Healing:** Kubernetes automatically restarts containers that fail, replaces and reschedules containers when nodes die, and kills containers that don't respond to user-defined health checks.
- **Scaling:** Kubernetes allows horizontal scaling of applications by adding or removing instances of containers based on CPU usage or other metrics.
- **Rolling Updates and Rollbacks:** Kubernetes enables seamless updates to applications with rolling updates, ensuring zero downtime. It also supports rollbacks to previous versions if issues arise.
- **Storage Orchestration:** Kubernetes provides flexible options for storage, allowing containers to use local storage, network storage, or cloud storage solutions.
