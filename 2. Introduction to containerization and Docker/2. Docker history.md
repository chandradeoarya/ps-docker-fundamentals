# Docker history
## **The Early Days**

### **Dotcloud and PaaS**

The story of Docker begins with a company called Dotcloud, founded by Solomon Hykes in 2010. Dotcloud was initially a Platform as a Service (PaaS) provider, aiming to simplify the deployment and management of applications in the cloud. 

### **Containers: The Inspiration**

Inspired by the concept of lightweight Linux Containers (LXC), which provide isolated execution environments for applications, Hykes started exploring the idea of a platform-agnostic containerization solution.

He recognized the potential of containers in simplifying software development and deployment, making it easier to ship applications across different systems without worrying about underlying infrastructure dependencies.

## **The Birth of Docker**

### **The First Prototype**

In 2013, Solomon Hykes released the first version of Docker as an open-source project. This initial prototype built upon the containerization capabilities of LXC and combined them with a simple, user-friendly interface. The primary goal was to provide a consistent runtime environment for applications, ensuring that they would run the same regardless of the host system.

### **Docker, Inc.**

In 2013, Docker, Inc. (formerly known as dotCloud, Inc.) was founded to support and commercialize the Docker project. Docker, Inc. provided enterprise-level support, training, and consulting services for organizations adopting Docker in production environments. The company also introduced Docker Hub, a cloud-based service for sharing and distributing container images.

## **Containerization Goes Mainstream**

### **Industry Adoption and Standardization**

As Docker gained popularity, major technology companies and organizations embraced containerization as a key component of their infrastructure strategies. Docker became an industry standard for packaging and deploying applications, with support from leading cloud providers, Linux distributions, and orchestration frameworks.

### **Kubernetes and Container Orchestration**

In 2014, Google open-sourced Kubernetes, a container orchestration platform originally developed for managing their

own massive-scale container deployments. Kubernetes, often referred to as K8s, quickly became the de facto standard for container orchestration, complementing Docker's containerization capabilities. Docker containers could be seamlessly managed and scaled using Kubernetes, further driving the adoption of containerization technologies.
