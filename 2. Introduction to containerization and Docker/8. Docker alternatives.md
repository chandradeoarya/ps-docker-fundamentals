Docker is the de fato standard for creating and managing containerized applications, however, there are several alternatives for Docker that can also be used for this purpose. Podman, LXD, Buildah are some of the popular docker alternatives availabletoday. 

In this lesson, weâ€™ll discuss top two Docker alternatives: Podman and LXD.

## Podman

Podman has been developed by RedHat. It is a daemonless, root-less, open-source, Linux-native container engine which is considered one of the best alternatives for Docker. This is an all-in-one software that is responsible for creating, running, and managing containers.

It provides interface for interacting with the containers, allowing developers to create, start, stop, and manage containers. 

**Advantages of using Podman**

1. Easy to use
2. Compatible with Kubernetes
3. Support for multiple container formats
4. Support for Cgroups v2
5. Support for Network Namespaces

## LXD

LXD has been developed and maintained by Canonicals. It allows multiple isolated Linux systems (containers) to run on a single host, providing a lightweight alternative to virtual machines. It also provides cgroup and namespace isolation as well as API and CLI experience. 

**Advantages of using LXD**

1. Lightweight and fast
2. Compatible with existing Linux distributions and tools
3. High Security, Scalability, High-availability
4. Advanced features like live migration, storage and network management
