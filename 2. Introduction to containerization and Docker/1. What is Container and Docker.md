# Docker intro

## What is container

Container is a standardized unit of software that packages up your code and all its dependencies. This allows the application to run quickly and reliably on any system that supports containers. 

It is like a shipping container for software - all the necessary parts are bundled together so it can be easily shipped and deployed from one environment to another.

### What is Docker

Docker is an open-source platform that uses containerization to develop, ship, and run applications. Containers are lightweight and isolated from each other, so they share the host operating system's kernel but run independently. This makes them portable and efficient.

## Docker components
Docker is a containerization platform that allows you to package and deploy applications and their dependencies as portable containers.

The main components of Docker are as follows:

1. **Docker Engine:** This is the runtime environment for Docker containers. 

2. **Docker Images:** Docker images are read-only templates that contain the necessary files and dependencies.
3. **Docker Containers:** Containers are the instances of Docker images. 
4. **Docker Compose:** Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container applications. 
5. **Docker Registry:** A Docker registry is a centralized repository that stores Docker images.
6. **Docker Volumes:** Docker volumes are used to persist data generated by containers.
7. **Docker Networking:** Docker provides networking capabilities to enable communication between containers and other systems. 

These are the main components of Docker we will learn each of them in details as we go along.
