### What is a Virtual Machine?

A virtual machine (VM) is a software emulation of a physical computer. It runs an operating system and applications just like a physical computer.

## **Key Differences**

| Feature | Docker | Virtual Machine |
| --- | --- | --- |
| System Resource Usage | Docker containers are lightweight as they share the host OS kernel and use less resources. | VMs are heavyweight as each VM runs a full-fledged guest operating system with its own resources. |
| Boot-up Time | Docker containers have shorter boot-up time, often in milliseconds. | VMs typically take a longer time to boot, just like a regular computer. |
| Portability | Docker containers are highly portable as they encapsulate the application and its dependencies. | VMs are less portable due to the reliance on specific hypervisors and hardware configurations. |
| Isolation | Docker provides process-level isolation. | VMs provide full system-level isolation. |
| Scalability | Docker provides high scalability due to its lightweight nature. | VMs are less scalable due to higher resource usage. |

##  When to use Docker?

Docker is best suited for:

- Developing microservices-based applications where isolation, scalability, and speed are key factors.
- CI/CD pipelines to ensure consistency across multiple development and deployment cycles.
- When the host and container operating systems are the same or similar.

## **When to use Virtual Machines?**

Virtual Machines are best suited for:

- Situations where you need to run multiple applications with different operating system requirements on the same hardware.
- Environments that require full system isolation for security.
- Applications that require all the resources and functionalities of an OS.
