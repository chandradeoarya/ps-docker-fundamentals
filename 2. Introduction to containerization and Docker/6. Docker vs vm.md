# Introduction

Virtualization is a key technology that helps us achieve efficiency by creating multiple virtual environments on a single physical machine. Docker and VMs are used a lot in these scenarios. 

Docker is considered ideal for rapid development due to lightweight, speedy, and highly portable containers especially in the context of microservices and CI/CD. At the same time, VMs provide full system-level isolation, making them suitable for running applications that require specific OS or system configurations.

In this lesson, we will be comparing Docker and Virtual Machines (VMs) while looking at bare-metal as well. Understanding these differences is critical to choosing the right tool.

## **1. Introduction**

### 1.1 What is Bare Metal

Bare metal refers to using original hardware directly, where an operating system like Windows or Linux is installed directly. You have complete control over the hardware, but downside is running just one operating system and application set per server. This can be inefficient, especially if the workload is low.

### **1.2 What is Docker?**

Docker is an open-source platform that uses containerization technology to package and run applications with their dependencies in isolated environments called containers.

### **1.3 What is a Virtual Machine?**

A virtual machine (VM) is a software emulation of a physical computer. It runs an operating system and applications just like a physical computer.

## **2. Key Differences**

| Feature | Docker | Virtual Machine |
| --- | --- | --- |
| System Resource Usage | Docker containers are lightweight as they share the host OS kernel and use less resources. | VMs are heavyweight as each VM runs a full-fledged guest operating system with its own resources. |
| Boot-up Time | Docker containers have shorter boot-up time, often in milliseconds. | VMs typically take a longer time to boot, just like a regular computer. |
| Portability | Docker containers are highly portable as they encapsulate the application and its dependencies. | VMs are less portable due to the reliance on specific hypervisors and hardware configurations. |
| Isolation | Docker provides process-level isolation. | VMs provide full system-level isolation. |
| Scalability | Docker provides high scalability due to its lightweight nature. | VMs are less scalable due to higher resource usage. |

## **3. When to use Docker?**

Docker is best suited for:

- Developing microservices-based applications where isolation, scalability, and speed are key factors.
- CI/CD pipelines to ensure consistency across multiple development and deployment cycles.
- When the host and container operating systems are the same or similar.

## **4. When to use Virtual Machines?**

Virtual Machines are best suited for:

- Situations where you need to run multiple applications with different operating system requirements on the same hardware.
- Environments that require full system isolation for security.
- Applications that require all the resources and functionalities of an OS.

In summary, Docker is the most preferred way for microservices based application and VMs for applications using different OS. 

Bare metal is Ideal for applications requiring maximum control, performance, and security (e.g., high-frequency trading).
