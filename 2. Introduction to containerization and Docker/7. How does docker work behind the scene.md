# How does docker work behind the scene
Docker is a powerful tool for building, shipping, and running applications in containers. Docker containers are lightweight and portable. One of the key features of Docker is its ability to provide isolation between containers and the host system. 

Docker leverages kernel namespaces and control groups (cgroups); these two key features of the Linux kernel which enables better isolation between the processes.

In this lesson, we'll learn how Docker utilizes these mechanisms to create isolated environments for running applications.

## Namespace

Namespace wraps a global system resource in an abstraction that makes it appear to the processes within the namespace that they have their own isolated instance of the global resource.

When you initialize a container, docker generates a set of namespaces for the container and every container has its own unique set of namespaces.

**There are various types of namespaces with different properties:**

- User/UIDs namespaces - a container running within the user namespace is isolated from the User IDs and Group IDs of other containers, making them unaware of each other's existence.
- UTS namespaces - isolate hostname and domain name information.
- IPC namespaces - isolate IPC method.
- Net namespaces - isolate network interfaces.
- PID namespaces - isolate process IDs.
- Mount namespaces - isolate mount points.

## Cgroup

Control Groups provide a mechanism for aggregating/partitioning sets of tasks, and all their future children, into hierarchical groups with specialized behaviour.

**Cgroups involve resource metering and limiting:**

- CPU - limit CPU utilization.
- Memory - limit memory usage.
- Disk I/O - limit disk I/O.
- Network - limit network bandwidth.

### Using cgroup with docker

- Limiting container to half of CPU.

```bash
docker run --cpus 0.5 -d nginx

```

- Limiting container memory usage

```bash
docker run -d --name new-container --memory=256M ubuntu sleep infinity
```
