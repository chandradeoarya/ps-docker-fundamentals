## Introduction

Docker CICD pipeline is used to automate the process of building, testing, and deploying applications. This is crucial to achieve the following advantages:

### Importance of CICD in Docker

- **Automated Processes:** With CICD deployments become automated and fast. This reduces errors and inconsistencies.
- **Efficient & consistent environment:** Automated and consistent development, testing, and production environments leads to fewer errors and more reliable deployments.
- **Fast releases:** Fast release helps you to keep up with competition or respond to changing needs by delivering features faster.

## Sample CI Pipleline:

We can create a workflow file (e.g., **`.github/workflows/docker.yml`**) in our own GitHub repository to define the CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions.

```yaml
name: Docker CI/CD

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Build Docker image
      run: docker build -t myapp .

    - name: Test Docker image
      run: docker run myapp npm test

    - name: Push Docker image to Docker Hub
      uses: docker/login-action@v1
      with:
        username: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME }}
        password: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_PASSWORD }}
    - name: Push Docker image to Docker Hub
      run: |
        docker tag myapp ${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME }}/myapp:latest
        docker push ${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME }}/myapp:latest
```

Using this pipeline you can simply push changes and automatically it is built as docker image with CI pipeline. We can later include CD step with Kubernetes.
