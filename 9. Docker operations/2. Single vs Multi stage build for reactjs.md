# Overview

In this lesson, you will learn how to build and run a React.js application using Docker. We will explore two different approaches: Docker Build (Single Stage) and Docker Build (Multi-Stage). The goal is to understand the differences between these approaches and compare the resulting image sizes.

## Step-by-Step Lab

### 1. Setting up the React.js Application

Before diving into Docker, let's set up a basic React.js application. Follow these steps:

1. Install Node.js and npm on your local machine if you haven't already.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the desired directory where you want to create your React.js application.
3. Run the following command to create a new React.js application using the `create-react-app` tool:
    
    ```bash
    npx create-react-app my-react-app
    ```
    
4. Once the command finishes executing, navigate into the newly created directory:
    
    ```bash
    cd my-react-app
    ```
    
5. Launch the development server by running the following command:
    
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    
    This will start the React.js application on a local development server, usually at `http://localhost:3000`. Confirm that the application is running by opening this URL in your browser.
    

### 2. Docker Build (Single Stage)

Now that our React.js application is up and running, let's containerize it using Docker Build (Single Stage). Follow these steps:

1. Create a new file in the root directory of your React.js application called `Dockerfile` (no file extension).
2. Open the `Dockerfile` in a text editor and add the following content:
    
    ```bash
    # Use an official Node.js runtime as the base image
    FROM node:14-alpine
    
    # Set the working directory in the container
    WORKDIR /app
    
    # Copy the package.json and package-lock.json files to the container
    COPY package*.json ./
    
    # Install the project dependencies
    RUN npm install
    
    # Copy the entire application code to the container
    COPY . .
    
    # Build the React.js application
    RUN npm run build
    
    # Set the command to run the application when the container starts
    CMD ["npm", "start"]
    ```
    
3. Save the `Dockerfile`.
4. Open a terminal or command prompt in the root directory of your React.js application.
5. Run the following command to build a Docker image using the `Dockerfile`:
    
    ```bash
    docker build -t my-react-app-single-stage .
    ```
    
    This command will build the Docker image with the tag `my-react-app-single-stage`.
    
6. Once the build process completes, you can run the containerized React.js application using the following command:
    
    ```bash
    docker run -p 8080:3000 my-react-app-single-stage
    ```
    
    The application will be accessible at `http://localhost:8080`.
    

### 3. Docker Build (Multi-Stage)

Now, let's explore the Docker Build (Multi-Stage) approach, which allows us to create a smaller final image. Follow these steps:

1. Create a new file in the root directory of your React.js application called `Dockerfile` (no file extension).
2. Open the `Dockerfile` in a text editor and add the following content:
    
    ```
    # Stage 1: Build the React.js application
    FROM node:14-alpine as build
    
    WORKDIR /app
    
    COPY package*.json ./
    
    RUN npm install
    
    COPY . .
    
    RUN npm run build
    
    # Stage 2: Create the final image
    FROM nginx
    
    # Copy the built React.js application from the previous stage
    COPY --from=build /app/build /usr/share/nginx/html
    
    # Expose port 80 to the outside world
    EXPOSE 80
    
    # Start the Nginx server
    CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
    ```
    
    Notice that we use **`node:14-alpine`** as the build image and **`nginx`** as the final image.
    
    1. Save the **`Dockerfile`**.
    2. Open a terminal or command prompt in the root directory of your React.js application.
    3. Run the following command to build a Docker image using the **`Dockerfile`**:
        
        ```bash
        docker build -t my-react-app-multi-stage .
        ```
        
        This command will build the Docker image with the tag **`my-react-app-multi-stage`**.
        
    4. Once the build process completes, you can run the containerized React.js application using the following command:
        
        ```bash
        docker run -p 8080:80 my-react-app-multi-stage
        ```
        
        The application will be accessible at **`http://localhost:8080`**.
        

## Image Size Comparison

After completing both approaches, compare the sizes of the Docker images generated by Docker Build (Single Stage) and Docker Build (Multi-Stage). To do this, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Run the following commands to get the sizes of the Docker images:
    
    ```
    docker images my-react-app-single-stage
    docker images my-react-app-multi-stage
    ```
    
    Note down the values of the `SIZE` column for each image.
    
3. Compare the sizes of the two images and note any significant differences.
