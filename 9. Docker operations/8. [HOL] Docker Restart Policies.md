## Introduction

Docker provides a restart policy feature that controls the behavior of a container when it exits or is stopped. By default, Docker containers will not automatically restart when they exit. However, you can configure the restart policy to restart the container under specific circumstances.

## Steps

### **Step 1: Understand the Default Restart Policy**

By default, Docker containers do not restart automatically when they exit. Let's verify this behavior by running a container without specifying a restart policy:

```bash
docker run -d --name no_restart_policy nginx
```

Check the status of the container:

```bash
docker ps -a
```

You'll notice that the container has exited and is not running anymore.

## **Available Restart Policies**

Docker provides different restart policies to handle container restarts. 

- **`no`**: Do not automatically restart the container.
- **`always`**: Always restart the container regardless of the exit status.
- **`unless-stopped`**: Restart the container unless it is explicitly stopped by the user.
- **`on-failure`**: Restart the container only if it exits with a non-zero exit status.

## **Step 2: Set a Restart Policy**

Now, let's set a restart policy for a container. We'll use the **`always`** policy to ensure that the container restarts automatically:

```bash
docker run -d --name always_restart --restart always nginx
```

Check the status of the container and ensure it is running:

```bash
docker ps
```

### **Test Restart Behavior**

Stop the container to simulate an exit:

```bash
docker stop always_restart
```

Verify that the container restarts automatically:

```bash
docker ps
```

You should see the container running again.
