### **Description**

In Docker, containers are typically connected to a bridge network, which allows them to communicate with each other and the external world. However, there are scenarios where you might need containers to directly use the host network for networking purposes. This is where host networking comes into play.

Host networking in Docker allows containers to bypass the network isolation provided by the bridge network and instead directly use the host machine's network stack. This can be useful in situations where you want to access services running on the host machine or when you require low-level access to network resources.

In this lab, we will create a simple web server container using host networking and test its connectivity from the host machine.

### Step 1: Start a container with host networking

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Run the following command to start a container using host networking:
    
    ```bash
    docker run -d --name web-server --network host nginx
    ```
    
    This command starts a new container named **`web-server`** using the **`nginx`** image and enables host networking using the **`--network host`** flag.
    

### Step 2: Verify the container status

1. Run the following command to verify the status of the **`web-server`** container:
    
    ```bash
    docker ps
    ```
    
    You should see the **`web-server`** container listed with a status of "Up."
