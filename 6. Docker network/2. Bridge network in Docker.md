## Introduction

The Default Bridge network is the default network driver in Docker. It allows containers on the same host to communicate with each other using the bridge network. This network driver is easy to set up and provides a basic level of connectivity for containerized applications.

- Check if the docker service is up and running.

```bash
systemctl status docker
```

- List all networks available in Docker, and explain types of networks.

```bash
docker network ls
```

- Run two `alpine` containers with interactive shell, in detached mode, name the container as `docker-chandra-container1` and `docker-chandra-container2`, and add command to run alpine shell. Here, explain what the detached mode means.

```bash
docker run -dit --name docker-chandra-container1 alpine sh
docker run -dit --name docker-chandra-container2 alpine sh
```

- Show the list of running containers on Docker machine.

```bash
docker ps
```

- Show the details of `bridge` network, and explain properties (subnet, ips) and why containers are in the default network bridge.

```bash
docker network inspect bridge | less
```

- Ping google.com four times to check internet connection.

```bash
ping -c 4 google.com
```

- Stop and delete the containers

```bash
docker stop docker-chandra-container1 docker-chandra-container2
docker rm docker-chandra-container1 docker-chandra-container2
```

## User defined Bridge network 

- Create a bridge network `docker_chandra_net`.

```bash
docker network create --driver bridge docker_chandra_net
```

- List all networks available in Docker, and show the user-defined `docker_chandra_net`.

```bash
docker network ls
```

- Show the details of `docker_chandra_net`, and show that there is no container yet.

```bash
docker network inspect docker_chandra_net
```
