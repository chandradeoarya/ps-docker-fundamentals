# Introduction

Docker Compose makes it easier to manage and deploy multi-container applications, ensuring consistent environments across different systems and improving the overall development and deployment workflow.

In this lab we will learn how to use Docker Compose to manage your Spring application and MySQL database in a single configuration file.

# Steps:

## **Step 1: Create a `docker-compose.yml` File**

1. **Create a new file named `docker-compose.yml`** in the same directory as your `Dockerfile`.
2. **Add the following content to the `docker-compose.yml` file:**

```yaml
version: "3.8"

services:
  app:
    container_name: golden-app
    build: .
    ports:
    - 8080:8080
    environment:
    - GOLDEN_DB_URL=db
    - GOLDEN_DB_NAME=goldenwaste
    - GOLDEN_DB_USERNAME=chandra
    - GOLDEN_DB_PASSWORD=instructor123
    - GOLDEN_DB_PORT=3306
    depends_on:
      db:
        condition: service_healthy
    networks:
    - goldenwaste-network

  db:
    container_name: goldenwastesqldb
    image: mysql:8.3
    ports:
    - 3306:3306
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: Chandra9876
      MYSQL_DATABASE: goldenwaste
      MYSQL_USER: chandra
      MYSQL_PASSWORD: instructor123
    volumes:
    - goldenwaste-mysql:/var/lib/mysql
    - goldenwaste-mysql-config:/etc/mysql
    networks:
    - goldenwaste-network
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "mysqladmin" ,"ping", "-h", "localhost"]
      timeout: 20s
      retries: 10

volumes:
  goldenwaste-mysql:
  goldenwaste-mysql-config:

networks:
  goldenwaste-network:
    name: goldenwaste-network
    driver: bridge

```

## **Step 2: Run the Application and Database**

1. **Navigate to the directory containing your `docker-compose.yml` file.**
2. **Start the Spring application and MySQL container using Docker Compose:**
    
    ```yaml
    docker compose up -d
    ```
    
    - **Explanation:**
        - `docker-compose up -d`: Instructs Docker Compose to bring up all defined services in detached mode (running in the background)

## **Step 3: Verify the Application**

- Access your Spring application in a web browser at `http://localhost:8080`. You should see your Spring application running successfully, now connected to the MySQL database container managed by Docker Compose.
