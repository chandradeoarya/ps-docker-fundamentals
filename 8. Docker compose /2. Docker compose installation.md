## **Objective**

The objective of this hands-on lab tutorial is to guide DevOps students through the process of installing Docker Compose on their systems. Docker Compose is an essential tool for managing multi-container Docker applications.

## **Step 1: Verifying the prerequisites**

Before installing Docker Compose, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- Docker is installed on your system.
- Command-line access to your system with administrative privileges.

## **Step 2: Downloading the Docker Compose binary**

1. Download the latest stable release of Docker Compose using the following command:
    
    ```bash
    sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/latest/download/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
    ```
    
    This command downloads the Docker Compose binary and saves it as **`/usr/local/bin/docker-compose`**
    

## **Step 3: Applying executable permissions to the binary**

1. Once the download is complete, apply executable permissions to the Docker Compose binary using the following command:
    
    ```bash
    sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
    ```
    
    This command makes the **`docker-compose`** binary executable.
    

## **Step 4: Verifying the installation**

1. Verify that Docker Compose is installed by checking its version:
    
    ```bash
    docker-compose --version
    ```
    
    This command should display the version information for Docker Compose, confirming that it is successfully installed.
    
2. Verify that Docker Compose is working correctly by running a simple test:
    
    ```bash
    docker-compose --help
    ```
    
    This command displays the help documentation for Docker Compose, indicating that it is working properly.
