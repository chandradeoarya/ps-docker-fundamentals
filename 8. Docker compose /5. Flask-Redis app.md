## Introduction

Building a Flask Application with Redis Backend Using Docker and Docker Compose

### **Lab Overview:**

In this hands-on lab, you will learn how to set up a simple web application using Flask, a popular Python web framework, and Redis, an in-memory data structure store used as a database, cache, and message broker. You will then containerize the application using Docker and orchestrate it using Docker Compose.

## **Lab Objectives:**

**By the end of this lab, you will be able to:**

- Create a project folder for your Flask application.
- Set up a Flask application that maintains a hit counter using Redis.
- Create a **`requirements.txt`** file to manage Python dependencies for your application.
- Build a Docker image for your application and understand its functionalities.
- Create a **`docker-compose.yml`** file to define your application's services.
- Build and run your application using Docker Compose.
- Configure security group rules on AWS to allow access to your application.
- Test your application in a browser.
- Monitor and manage Docker containers using Docker Compose.

## **Lab Steps:**

1. Create a project folder.
2. Set up the Flask application and Redis.
3. Define your Python dependencies in a **`requirements.txt`** file.
4. Create a Dockerfile for your application and understand its functionalities.
5. Define your application's services in a **`docker-compose.yml`** file.
6. Build and run your application using Docker Compose.
7. Configure your AWS instance's security group to allow TCP connections on port 5000.
8. Test your application in a browser.
9. Monitor the containers created by Docker Compose.
10. Clean up by removing the containers using Docker Compose.

## Lab:

- Create a folder for the project:

```bash
mkdir flask_redis_compose
cd flask_redis_compose
```

- Create a file called `app.py` in your project folder and paste the following python code in it. In this example, the application uses the Flask framework and maintains a hit counter in Redis, and `redis` is the hostname of the `Redis container` on the application’s network. We use the default port for Redis, `6379`.

```python
import time

import redis
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)
cache = redis.Redis(host='redis', port=6379)

def get_hit_count():
    retries = 5
    while True:
        try:
            return cache.incr('hits')
        except redis.exceptions.ConnectionError as exc:
            if retries == 0:
                raise exc
            retries -= 1
            time.sleep(0.5)

@app.route('/')
def hello():
    count = get_hit_count()
    return 'Hello World! I have been seen {} times.\n'.format(count)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5000)
```

- Create another file called `requirements.txt` in your project folder, add `flask` and `redis` as package list.

```bash
echo '
flask
redis
' > requirements.txt
```

- Create a Dockerfile which builds a Docker image and explain what it does.

```
The image contains all the dependencies for the application, including Python itself.
1. Build an image starting with the Python 3.7 image.
2. Set the working directory to `/code`.
3. Set environment variables used by the flask command.
4. Install gcc and other dependencies
5. Copy `requirements.txt` and install the Python dependencies.
6. Add metadata to the image to describe that the container is listening on port 5000
7. Copy the current directory `.` in the project to the workdir `.` in the image.
8. Set the default command for the container to flask run.
```

```bash
echo '
FROM python:alpine
RUN apk update && \
    apk add --no-cache build-base libffi-dev openssl-dev
COPY . /app
WORKDIR /app
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
EXPOSE 5000
CMD python ./app.py
' > Dockerfile
```

- Create a file called `docker-compose.yml` in your project folder and define services and explain services.

```
This Compose file defines two services: web and redis.

### Web service
The web service uses an image that’s built from the Dockerfile in the current directory. It then binds the container and the host machine to the exposed port, 5000. This example service uses the default port for the Flask web server, 5000.

### Redis service
The redis service uses a public Redis image pulled from the Docker Hub registry.
```

```bash
echo '
version: "3"
services:
  web:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "9876:5000"
  redis:
    image: "redis:alpine"
' > docker-compose.yml
```

- Build and run your app with `Docker Compose` and explains what is happening.

```
Docker compose pulls a Redis image, builds an image for our the app code,
and starts the services defined. In this case, the code is statically copied into the image at build time.
```

```bash
docker-compose up
```

- Add a rule within the security group of Docker Instance allowing TCP connections through port `5000` from anywhere in the AWS Management Console.

```
Type        : Custom TCP
Protocol    : TCP
Port Range  : 5000
Source      : 0.0.0.0/0
Description : -
```

- Enter http://`ec2-host-name:5000/` in a browser to see the application running.
- Press `Ctrl+C` to stop containers, and run `docker ps -a` to see containers created by Docker Compose.
- Remove the containers with `Docker Compose`.

```bash
docker-compose down
```
