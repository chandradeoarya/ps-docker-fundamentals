## Introduction

A Docker volume is a feature in Docker that provides a way to persist and manage data in containerized environments. It allows containers to store and access data independent of the container lifecycle, ensuring data persistence even when containers are stopped, restarted, or removed.

### Why to use Docker volume

Docker volumes are used to overcome the limitation of storing data within a container's writable layer, which gets reset or lost when the container is destroyed. By using volumes, data can be stored outside the container and shared among multiple containers, facilitating data exchange and collaboration.

**Docker volumes have the following key characteristics:**

- **Data Persistence:** Volumes allow data to persist beyond the lifecycle of a container. Even if a container is removed or replaced, the data stored in the volume remains intact.
- **Shared Data:** Volumes enable multiple containers to share and access the same data. This allows for communication and collaboration between containers, as they can read and write to the shared volume.
- **Decoupled Data Management:** Volumes separate the management of data from the container itself. This means that data can be updated, backed up, or restored without affecting the container's functionality or configuration.
