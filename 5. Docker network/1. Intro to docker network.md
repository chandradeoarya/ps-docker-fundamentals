## **Docker Networking Overview**

Docker provides a flexible and powerful networking model that allows containers to communicate with each other and with the external world. By default, Docker containers run in an isolated network namespace, meaning they have their own network stack and IP address. However, Docker networking provides several options for connecting containers, enabling various network topologies and communication patterns.

# **Types of Docker Network Drivers:**

## **Bridge Network Driver**

- Default network driver in Docker.
- Allows containers on the same host to communicate with each other.
- Limited scalability and lacks cross-host communication.

## **Overlay Network Driver**

- Enables multi-host communication across multiple Docker daemons or swarm services.
- Achieves network isolation and provides seamless connectivity between containers in different hosts.
- Suitable for multi-host deployments, such as Docker Swarm or Kubernetes clusters.

## **Host Network Driver**

- Containers use the host's network stack directly.
- Offers high performance as there is no overhead of virtualization.
- Reduced network isolation since containers share the host's network namespace.
- Useful for performance-critical applications that require direct access to the host's network stack.
