# Dojo jump on docker

- Create a file `Dockerfile` inside dojo-jump project folder. 
https://github.com/chandradeoarya/dojo-jump

- Write the following contents

```
FROM nginx

COPY index.html /usr/share/nginx/html
COPY style.css /usr/share/nginx/html
COPY main.js /usr/share/nginx/html

EXPOSE 80

```

- Build and run the image

```
docker build -t "dj:1.0" .
docker run -itd -p 8080:80 --name dojo-jump dj:1.0

```

# Pushing to Dockerhub 

Let's push this to docker hub.

Please use the version as you want.

- Build Docker image from Dockerfile locally, tag it as `<Your_Docker_Hub_Account_Name>/<Your_Image_Name>:<Tag>` and explain steps of building. Note that repo name is the combination of `<Your_Docker_Hub_Account_Name>/<Your_Image_Name>`.

```bash
docker build -t "chandradeoarya/dojo-jump:1.0" .
docker image ls
```

- Run the newly built image as container in detached mode, connect host `port 80` to container `port 80`, and name container as `welcome`. Then list running containers and connect to EC2 instance from the browser to show the Flask app is running.

```bash
docker run -d --name dojo-jump -p 80:80 chandradeoarya/dojo-jump:1.0

docker container ls
```
