## Overview

Infrastructure as code (IAC) is the process of managing and provisioning infrastructure using code, rather than manual configuration. This allows for more efficient and consistent infrastructure management, as well as easier collaboration and version control. Popular tools for IAC include Terraform, Ansible, and Puppet.

### Types of infrastructure as code

There are several types of infrastructure as code, including:

1. **Configuration management tools:** These tools, such as Ansible, Chef, and Puppet, allow you to manage the configuration of your infrastructure. 
2. **Provisioning tools:** These tools, such as Terraform and CloudFormation, allow you to provision infrastructure resources, such as virtual machines and databases, on various cloud platforms.
3. **Container orchestration tools:** These tools, such as Kubernetes and Docker Swarm, allow you to manage and scale containerized applications.
4. **Serverless frameworks:** These frameworks, such as AWS Lambda and Azure Functions, allow you to run code without the need to provision or manage servers.

## Benefits of IaC

There are several benefits of using infrastructure as code, including:

1. Version control: This allows for better collaboration and rollback in case of issues.
2. Automation: This reduces manual configuration and decreasing the chances of errors.
3. Consistency: Helps in ensuring consistency across different environments, such as development, staging, and production.
4. Scalability: Allows easy scaling of resources.
