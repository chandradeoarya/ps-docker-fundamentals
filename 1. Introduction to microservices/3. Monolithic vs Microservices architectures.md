Selecting the right architecture is crucial for building robust and scalable applications. In this lesson we will compare two popular approaches i.e. monolithic and microservices architectures.

This table highlights the key differences between Monolithic and Microservices architectures in terms of codebase structure, deployment, scalability etc.

| Characteristic | Monolithic | Microservices |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Codebase | Single, unified codebase | Multiple, independent codebases for each service |
| Deployment | Entire application deploys together | Individual services can be deployed independently |
| Scalability | Scales vertically (adding more resources to a single server) | Scales horizontally (adding more instances of individual services) |
| Development & Maintenance | Changes require modifying and redeploying the entire application | Changes can be made to individual services without affecting others |
| Complexity | Simpler to understand and manage for small applications | Can be more complex to manage and requires good communication between teams |
| Integration | Components tightly coupled | Services communicate through APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) |
| Fault Tolerance | Failure in one part can bring down the entire application | Failure in one service is isolated and doesn't affect others |
| Technology Stack | Limited to technologies supported by the chosen language/framework | Can leverage different technologies for different services |
