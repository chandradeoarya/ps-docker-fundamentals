## What is statelessness

Statelessness refers to the characteristic of a system or component that does not retain information about the state of past interactions. It means that each microservice operates independently and does not store any client session state or context. Instead, it relies solely on the information provided with each request to perform its task.

### **Stateful vs Stateless applications**

**This table compares key Characteristics of Stateful and Stateless apps**

| Key Characteristics | Stateful | Stateless |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Independent and Isolated | Microservices tightly coupled, sharing state across the system. | Microservices operate independently from one another. |
| No Client Session State | Requires session state management on server Sessions are maintained for client interactions. | Does not store client session state. Each request contains necessary information. |
| Scalability | Vertical scaling often required, limited by shared resources. | Horizontal scaling supported, instances can be added independently. |
| Fault Tolerance | Failure in one service affects others relying on its state. | Failure in one service doesn't impact others due to lack of shared state. |

## **Designing Statelessness**

- **Focus on tasks:** Each microservice should be designed to perform a specific, well-defined task. This promotes loose coupling and avoids the need to maintain complex state across interactions.
- **API design:** Design APIs that are self-contained and provide all the necessary data for the service to complete its task.
- **External storage:** For data persistence, rely on external storage solutions like databases or caching mechanisms. This separates state management from the microservice itself.

## How to build  a Stateless application?

**To make a microservice stateless, the following practices are commonly employed:**

1. **Externalize State**: Instead of storing client-specific state within the service instance, it should be stored in external data stores like databases, caches, or message queues. The service retrieves or updates the state from these external stores as needed.
2. **Embrace Immutable Infrastructure**: Microservices should be designed to run on immutable infrastructure, where instances are disposable and can be replaced with new instances without any state preservation. This aligns well with the principles of containerization and infrastructure as code.
3. **Avoid Sticky Sessions**: Sticky sessions, where a client's requests are routed to the same server instance, should be avoided. This introduces state management complexities and hinders scalability.
4. **Leverage Client-side State**: In some cases, client-side state (e.g., cookies, local storage) can be used to offload state management from the server-side microservices.
5. **Use Backing Services**: Leverage backing services like message queues or caches to store and retrieve state, enabling asynchronous communication and decoupling between services.
