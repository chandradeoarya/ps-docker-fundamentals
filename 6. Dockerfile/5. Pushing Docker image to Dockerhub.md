# Pushing Docker image to Dockerhub
Docker Hub is a cloud-based public registry provided by Docker, Inc. In this hands-on lab we will push a Docker image already created by us.

## Lab

- Login in to Docker with credentials.

```bash
docker login
```

- Push newly built image to Docker Hub, and show the updated repo on Docker Hub.

```bash
docker push chandradeoarya/devops_dockerfile_flask:1.0
```
