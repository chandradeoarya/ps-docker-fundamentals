# Dockerizing flask app

The purpose of this project is to provide a RESTful API for a to-do list application. This API allows users to manage their to-do tasks by providing functionalities to add, retrieve, update, and delete tasks. The API is built using Flask and the data is stored in a MySQL database.

In this lab we will dockerize the given app.
